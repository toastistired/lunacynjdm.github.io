        <center><p style="font-size:20">Forming in April 2021, Lunacy arose from a small neighborhood in Monmouth County, New Jersey. Since their arrival to the scene with their live debut in February of 2023, as well as the release of that year's <i>Ritual of Gore</i> EP, the band have been building their reputation. With appearances at venues such as the Meatlocker, Jimmy's Bar and Grill, and others, Lunacy have accrued a cult following, cementing their status in their local scene as band that pulls no punches.</p></center>

        <center><p style="font-size:20">Early in their career, Lunacy's trajectory was much different than what their future releases would imply, as evident by their five-track demo from June 2021. Building on their raw and decidedly heavy foundations, their venture continued with <i>Ritual of Gore</i>, which translated their intense live performances to a studio context without losing any of their edge in the process. The lineup of the band on <i>Ritual of Gore</i> is the same lineup that formed the band: guitarist/vocalist Ace Godavari, bassist/vocalist Evan Leifman, and drummer/vocalist Andrew Illuzzi.</p></center>

        <center><p style="font-size:20">Lunacy's unique sound, named by the members as "megablast", crossbreeds brutal death metal with technical proficiency and hardcore-esque energy. With each release, the band build on the "megablast", with elements such as free-flowing drumming, frequent use of bass guitar solos, technical and abrasive riffing, and gruff, over-the-top vocal performances. The sound of the band is coupled together with lyrical themes of life and death, the occult, revenge, and the ills of man, sometimes with a slant of morbid humor. Some of Lunacy's influences include, but are not limited to: Decapitated, Suffocation, Cryptopsy, Dying Fetus, and Cannibal Corpse, among others, includng several outside of the sphere of death metal.</p></center>

        <center><p style="font-size:20">With several chaotic and energetic performances in support of <i>Ritual of Gore</i>, Lunacy continues to hit stages across New Jersey and take no prisoners while doing so. With 2024 on the horizon, the trio seeks to release more music and are continuing to devastate stages across the state, with plans to expand their reaches...</p></center>
